1. New functionality:
    Through the efforts of Tom Russo,Greg Tawa, Barry Schneider,
    Jeff Hay, and Rich Martin, we now have:

    "direct" formation of j and k matrices in DFT calculations.
       (m511)
    dft gradients for closed-shell molecules.
       (m711,m721)
    population and atomic size analysis via becke partitioning.
       this works for both Hartree-Fock and DFT wavefunctions. 
       (m611)
    dielectric continuum model (arbritrary cavity surface) for solvation effects
       (m618,m619,m620,m621). implemented for both scf and dft cases.
    electric field gradient properties.
       (m1902)
    symmetry routines can do salc's for oh symmetry.
       (sym)
    a "mesa reader" to be used in conjunction with MSI's ChemistryViewer
       and AVS.  This allows one to do all the things ChemistryViewer does
       with a Gaussian file (view orbitals, densities, potential, etc.)
       using a MESA checkpoint file.
       (tools/avs)
    first pass at coulomb integrals via poisson solver.
       (not quite ready for prime time, m613).
2. DFT code has been sped up significantly.  
   Added a new library 'dft' for utility routines.  Standard grids now
   available for H-Ar.
3. Several minor bug fixes. Some housecleaning done.
      m811:  ints file removed after the half transformation to save disk.
      m1012: data now written to tints file so that ints is not necessary.
      m1013: hessian now written to tints.
      m1020: hessian now read from tints as opposed to ints.

      note that these changes should be transparent, if the integrals file
      is to be kept around, use transformation=keep-ints on the route.
      only known case where this is necessary is in conjunction with
      ci optimizations using the flag m812=check-energy, in which case
      m812 tries to open the ints file.
4. All properties have now been tested (with the exception of del**4), 
   and they look fine.
5. Added some new tests to the suite.  They put the new functionality
   through its paces.
      test1.5  --- does CuH+; tests d-functions, field gradients, fermi contact.
      test11.5 --- h2o, BLYP, standard grids
      test11.6 --- h2o, "direct j-matrix"
      test11.7 --- h2o, BLYP, analytic optimization
      test11.8 --- h2o, BLYP, fletcher-powell optimization
      test13.1 --- ch3cl2 ion-dipole complex in h2o, 
                   dielectric continuum solvent test
6. The 6-31G* basis sets for the first and second rows have been added to
    mesa.dat.  [6s5p2d] contractions of Wachters' bases for first transition
    series are available.  Specify basis=wachters, or basis=wachters-hay
    for the [6s5p3d] with diffuse d-function.
7. The Sun and HP version now allocate core through malloc in getscm.f
    at the beginning of every run.  If you want to increase the amount of
    memory used, increase the size parameter on your submittal line, or
    change the default(6,000,000 dp words=48MBytes) in mesa.sh .
    The maxsiz directive in the $route section no longer works.
