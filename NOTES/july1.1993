1. Several bug fixes.  Problems with non-adiabatic coupling on
   some platforms have not been fixed(test9.1) -- this presumably
   relates to the entry point mess in m911.
2. New functionality:
    Through the sterling efforts of Tom Russo,Tony Rappe,Jeff Hay,
    Matt Braunstein,and Rich Martin, we now have:
    ecp gradients through g-functions (intgrl,m303,m712).
    ecp analytic second derivatives through f-functions (intgrl,m303,m712).
    closed and restricted open-shell dft (m511).
    spin-orbit ci (m304,m807,m904) -- compliments russ pitzer.
       note that this was originally interfaced with mesa by
       matt braunstein(lanl). matt also put together an integral
       link (m204) to compute the one-center approximation to the
       spin-orbit operator.  It has been tested for s and p functions;
       code exists, but has not been tested for d and f-functions.
       It is somewhat loosely coupled to mesa, in that two additional
       input files are needed:genin and ciin. the ci will work for
       any point group for systems with an even number of elecrons
       (rmp,summer 1992). For systems with an odd numner of electrons,
       the molecule must have c2v symmetry or higher.
    sgi version available compliments of tony rappe(csu).
3. Note that the values of the physical constants have been
   updated. This means that runs which used angstroms previously will now
   be slightly different because of a different conversion to bohr, etc.
   If you want to use the old ones specify "oldconstants" on the route.
4. Renamed link m203 to m732 and made appropriate changes.  This is because
   m731 transforms forces from cartesian to internal coordinates, 
   and 'old m203' transforms force constants from cartesian to internals.
5. Changed the syntax for second derivative runs so that it may make a 
   little more sense. The opt=() field is now used just to specify
   an optimization algorithm. If you want force-constants, you specify
   force-constants=(analytic,                          the default
                   (numerical=(internal, one-point     the numerical default
                               cartesian,two-point,    
                               stepsize)
   In fact, force-constants by itself defaults to analytic.
   Take a look at the tests in /usr2/mesa/tests/inp like
   test2.4,test2.5,test2.6,test2.7. This entailed some changes in the
   standard route specification in m1 and mesa.dat.
   I also made reasonable defaults in the case of force-constant runs
   i.e. you no longer have to specify nderiv=2 for analytic derivatives,
   scf=(core-fock) or transformation=scf for analytic derivatives.
   In addition, the keyword phrase transformation=scf is now known as
   transformation=canonical.
6. Added a new test2.10, and moved the old test2.10 to test2.11.  The
   new test does finite-difference force-constants for open shell scf.
   Also added test8.2,test8.3. Test 8.2 does finite-difference force
   constants using ecp derivatives. Test8.3 does analytic second derivative
   force-constants. The second derivative code has been tested using
   finite-difference through f-functions. By the way, changes were
   necessary to m712 in order to do second derivatives of f-functions
   even without ecp's. Also entailed modifying filmas.f to contain
   atomic masses for all the elements. Added tests 11.1-11.4, which test
   different functionals/ closed and restricted open shell dft. Finally, 
   modified the PPP test10.2 to a more stable situation, and added test10.3
   and 10.4. test10.3 goes through the spin-orbit ci links
   --- note that it doesn't have all the data needed to run so it should 
   be skipped over right now. Test10.4 excercises ci transition dipoles.
7. Modified m330 to destroy the raw integral file after the first half
   sort. For large cases, the rints file and the ints file no longer have
   to simultaneously reside on disk.
8. Modified lnkerr.f to send its message to the standard error.  This is
   usually the terminal, but can be set by modifying stderr.f in mdutil.
9. Some housecleaning done. Dead code moved into ghosts as it was found.
   Output for force-constant runs condensed. Modified fock.f and gdmat.f
   in m1011 so that they are identical to jandks.f and gdmat.f in both
   m501 and m503. We should move these to the library someday. Cut down
   the unnecessary printing in m204,m205.
10.Note that the output of the tests do not report the isotopes being
   used in the calculation properly (after distance matrix). They pick 
   the masses up fine, but the print bug was found after the tests were run,
   and fixed before version 4.3 was made and saved.
