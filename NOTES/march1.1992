1.  There are now sgemm and sgemv routines in the level 2 and 3 BLAS.
Unfortunately, the calling arguments are not compatible with the old
ones which originated in CLAMS at Los Alamos.  I have changed the arguyments
to reflect the BLAS routines wherever possible.  The routines which used to be
called sgemm and sgemv in CLAMS are now present as sgmm and sgmv.  They are
still called by some routines in MATH, because they offer transposition
capabilities which are not available in the BLAS.
2. A note on CLAMS. On many machines these routines are available from a
"fast" library.  Most of them are either BLAS, EISPACK, or LINPACK routines.
On those machines where they are available, the Makefile in library should
be modified so that CLAMS is not compiled (see PARTS), and rather the
LDFLAGS environment variable modified to include the "fast" library. I have
never actually done this, but it should work.
