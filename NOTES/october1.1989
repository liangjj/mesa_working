 2.  There are some new utility routines in the 199- series. 
      M1990 produces  wavefunction amplitude information for graphics on
        the STARDENT.
      M1991 does an orbital gross population analysis by interrogating
        a check file. 
      M889/M890 are temporary corruptions of M820 which produce a separate 
        file of canonical transformed integrals in case you want to send 
        them to your friends.

 3.  There are three new links that allow symmetry to be utilized to some
extent in the calulations.  M402 is essentially identical to M601. Both
of them project pure symmetry functions from their input (either guess
vectors or SCF vectors). M503 is an SCF code which symmetry blocks the
Fock matrix so that it should produce pure functions.  Look over the options
in M503 -- particularly occsym which allows you to solve for an excited
state as long as it is the lowest of its symmetry.  The 401/601 codes should be made subroutines to be called from 401/503 someday. The configuration 
generation routines M801,M802, and M805 have been modified to automatically
determine symmetry information.  The DRT lists now do not need the symmetry
of each orbital to be specified. If you wish to run in the old mode, 
override this stuff with DRT=(rdsym) in the route and the DRT looks just like
before. Compare h2o_ci in the tests/input section with h2o_sym_ci.
 4.  The allocation of core via the pointers is done more consistently now than
before, but this section is still a mess.  If we ever use up all the core
allocated in GetSCM I doubt that we wil die gracefully.  Some implementations
allow you to request the amount of core you wish to run in at the beginning
of the job (e.g. Stardent), while this has not yet been implemented in other
versions(see getscm in mdutil) and the available core is hardwired into the
blank common in getscm.
 5.  I went to lower case everywhere in the code.  I happen to like the
mixed format, but that isn't shared by everyone.  When it's not consistently
done it leads to alot of potential headaches.
 6.  The calls to iosys have presumably been fixed so that the last argument is
a character variable instead of an integer.
 7.  There are several test files in the directory tests/input.  There is also a
script (mesaprod) in tests which will run several decks back to back. 
It takes as standard input a file containing the names of the input decks.
Look at mesaprod to see that the pathnames hardwired there are appropriate
to your environment.   The results in output/sun4, etc. cannot be compared
to the ibm-aix in all cases.  The order in which things were run is different
so they picked up different geom=rdchk info, etc. We should have a sequence of
tests which feed each other the appropriate information and is somewhat more
automated.
 8.  One of the things I haven't addressed yet are the routines in 
library/clams: i1mach.f and r1mach.f .
These contain machine-specific data statements and should be made
compatible with the IBM.  Right now I'm using the SUN versions.  Several of the
codes in CLAMS should probably be moved to a machine dependent library so that
features of each machine could be taken advantage of. Unit strides so things fit
in the cache on the IBM, for example.
 ************************NOTE**************************
 Most of these have now been removed frome clams.  They
were used primarily to get binomial coefficients, and a new routine has been
written to do this.  Most of the routines in CLAMS are now from eispack or the
blas.  The routines SGEMM and SGEMV are the BLAS routines. They have slightly
different calling lists and some hings that out old versions did the new
standards cannot.  For this reason, the old sgemm and sgemv have been renamed
sgmm and sgmv and are found in .../math. Those routines in MATH and in main code
which could call the new standard sgemv and sgemm have been replaced, so that
platforms with optimized versions of the BLAS available can take advantage of it
see note 12.
9.  The codes put out some error messages about direct access READS, etc.
on the IBM-AIX.
This apparently doesn't affect the results and I have diverted
the stream of standard error in the scripts which control the run.
Whatever the problem is, it would be nice to have it fixed so we
see a real error mesage when one actually happens.
10.  We don't do much mrci optimization as of yet, and I haven't done thorough
tests of all that stuff.  M1001 obviously still has problems.
The h2o_mcscf_d2e, h2o_mrci_opt, h2o_mrci_fci, and h2o_mrci_fcc
jobs all give nonsense. 
11.  I have not fixed up the entry points or core allocation for m914,15,16.
We never had a version that worked here so you should do some comparison.
These codes have been moved to the directory .../ghosts
