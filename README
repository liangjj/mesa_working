***Installing MESA****

  1. Set environment variables in .cshrc or appropriate bash file.

           MESA_HOME =  /xxx/mesa_working
           * Location of your copy of mesa sources
           * the mesa.dat file should reside there or soft link to where it actually resides
           MESA_BIN =  /xxx/mesa/bin
           * Location of mesa executables and also where the run scripts
             look for the executables.  MESA_HOME has a bin subdirectory
             where one usually stores them but it can be anywhere.
           MESA_TMP  = /xxx/user/tmp
           * This is used by the Makefiles and scripts to set up the directory for the
             rwf, rint, int, etc. files. it should point to a place where you
             have plenty of room such as a large disk or SSD. It is essential to have a separate directory of
             this sort for each user, and perhaps even for each user on each machine that they use so
             that one users rwf file wont accidentally overwrite anothers.  While overwriting file names
             can be prevented by setting unique names, the default name is fixed.  Note also,
             When you set this, dont forget to actually create the /xxx/user/tmp
             directory.  I usually have a run directory on each machine and create a soft link to
             a directory with lots of space on that machine.  One certainly does not want MESA_TMP to
             be physically on another machine as one can imagine the time it will take to move large files
             to and from that space.
           * It has been shown useful for each user to set up a small directory in which they run mesa.  
             For example, I have a /xxx/mesa_working/run where I run the code and also create 
             the softlink to the MESA_TMP directory.  There are subdirectories of this directory
             such as  inp/    out/   chk/ to store needed input,output and check files.  
             I also keep my runmesa script there which runs the mesa jobs.  If run in the 
             background, there is a log file produced with timing statistics.


  2. Makefiles.

           *A lot of the original way in which the Makefiles were set up are now moot.
            The way things are set up currently, which may not be to everyones liking,
            is to use environment variables that are created at log in time.  These
            are either defined in your .cshrc or .bash_profile file or defined by scripts
            which are executed from the .cshrc or .bash_profile file.  The needed
            scripts are located in a directory /xxx/scripts.  Here is a snippet from
            my .bash_profile file;

                     SOURCES=/home/bis/Sources

                     COMPILER_VERSION=intel

                     MPI_VERSION=mvapich2

                     export $COMPILER_VERSION

                     echo '                       Information on Compiler'

                     echo 'Fortran Compiler = ' $COMPILER_VERSION

                   . $SOURCES/scripts/c_env.sh $COMPILER_VERSION

                   . $SOURCES/scripts/fortran_env.sh $COMPILER_VERSION

                   . $SOURCES/scripts/math_env.sh $COMPILER_VERSION

                   . $SOURCES/scripts/mpi_env.sh $MPI_VERSION

These scripts contain directives to create the environmental variables;

                      * F90                 the fortran compiler

                      * F90FLAGS            the compiler flags
