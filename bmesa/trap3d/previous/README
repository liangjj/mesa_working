Hi,
I made a directory called trap3d which has the subroutines and main program we
talked about.  The main program is trap3d.f and the code has a number of options.
Forgetting about many details of the utility subroutines which are used to enter data
and parse strings, the best approach is likely to be to walk through the code with
me and we can see where to ( or if ) continue in a fruitful fashion.  Best way to get
me is by email at this address.
