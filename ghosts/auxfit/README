These are codes that were developed in an aborted attempt at fitting the
Coulomb potential to an auxiliary basis set.  Ths is commonly done in
DFT implementations, and we were doing it here for SCF in the hope
that it might prove useful for perturbation theory.  There are some
potentially useful routines here in m352 which do three-center overlap
integrals, and three-center two-electron integrals. The link m105
reads in an auxiliary basis set, and 505 solves the SCF equations using
the auxiliary integrals.
