these routines were active when we called the "canned" spline routine.  it 
doesn't always seem to work well, so we have replaced it with our own.  the
advantages of these rotuines are that the spline order is variable, whereas 
the new one does cubic splines only, and a flag can be set so that the
derivative of the functions is returned as well as the function.
