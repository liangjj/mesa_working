Demonstration of using SuperLU

This demonstration assumes that all of SuperLU is installed
from the standard distribution

The linux makefile assumes that the installation is in
/usr/local/SuperLU

It makes use of its own version of the bridging routine
(driver that interfaces fortran to c)

The order of the test matrix and other parameters are all set in 
main.f    No input necessary

To use this demo:

1)  make  
2)  xtest > output

to clean up: 

1)  make clean
