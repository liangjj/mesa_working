c      ioopen: changing 'unitnm' and 'number'to character*256 variables to
c      allow for long file names to accomodate unix directory system.
c
c   31 january 1987  pws at lanl
c
c      bsd4.2 unix version on sun microsystems 3/50 and 3/160.
c      had to modify the fortran open statements in ioopen to 
c      remove some vaxism's such as 'initialsize'. also changed
c      'idum' from integer to character*8 and made 'pt' and 'nfiles'
c      character when putting them into or getting them from 'idum'.
c      finally, modified ioexist ('does ... exist on ...') to return
c      a character answer, rather than hollerith, since f77 complains
c      about an integer being set equal to a character string.

c
c***description        iosys is an attempt at a flexible, user-friendly
c i/o package which hides the machine dependent aspects of i/o. all i/o
c in the mesa system other than fortran formatted input and output
c should be performed using iosys. the form of a call to iosys is:
c
c          call iosys(directive,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
c
c where 'directive' is a character string giving (in english?) the
c action to be taken, and the remaining three arguments depend on what
c is being done.
c      in the following description of the directives <file> is an
c iosys internal file name; <unit> is an iosys internal unit name;
c parenthesis () indicate a choice of words, one of which must be used;
c and brackets [] indicate an optional keyword or phrase. also, all
c (hopefully) non-essential words such as 'to', 'on' and 'of' may be
c omitted wherever they appear; however, their inclusion is suggested
c as an aid to readability.
c      the possible directives are:
c        'length of <file> on <unit>'
c        'get length of <file> on <unit>'
c        'get maximum length of <file> on <unit>'
c        'get read pointer of <file> on <unit>'
c        'get write pointer of <file> on <unit>'
c        'does <file> exist on <unit>'
c        'write (character integer real) <file> (to,on) <unit>
c                    [without rewinding] [asynchronously]'
c        'read (character integer real) <file> from <unit>
c              [without rewinding] [asynchronously]'
c        'end <file> on <unit>'
c        'endfile <file> on <unit>'
c        'create (character integer real) <file> on <unit>'
c        'open <unit> [as (new,old,unknown,scratch)] [on ssd]'
c        'dump'
c        'destroy [<unit>]'
c        'close (all,<unit>)'
c        'wait for (all,<unit>)'
c        'rewind (all,<file>) on (all,<unit>)
c                 [(read,write,read-and-write)]'
c        'set alignment (for,of) <unit>'
c        'reset alignment (for,of) <unit>'
c
c      iosys manages collections of 'files' on 'units', which are
c actually physical disc files. iosys uses a directory to keep track
c of its logical 'files' on each of its logical 'units'. the first step
c in using iosys is to open one or more logical units using the 'open'
c directive. this is the only stage where the user must be cognizant of
c the physical file name associated with the logical units. after a
c unit is opened, it is always referred to by its logical name
c embedded in a directive string.
c
c     there are two ways to create a logical file on a unit: the first
c is simply by writing data to a new file name using the 'write'
c directive, the second is with an explicit 'create' directive. the
c first method will create a file exactly the length of the data being
c written; whereas, a 'create' directive allows the user to specify
c the length of the file. as a user, you will only need to explicitly
c create files only if all the data cannot be written to the file in
c one write. there is also a variant of the explicit create invoked
c by giving a length of -1. in this case, an 'endless' file is created,
c on which an unspecified amount of data may be written. an 'endless'
c file is active until an 'end' or 'endfile' directive is issued, at
c which point the 'endless' file is fixed to the current length and may
c not be further extended. there are restrictions on the use of
c 'endless' files: first, only one endless file can be active on a
c given unit at one time; and second, no new files may be created
c implicitly or explicitly on a unit with an active endless file.
c
c      logical file and unit names may have up to 16 characters; any
c beyond 16 are truncated. if the name contains embedded blanks, it
c must be enclosed in double quotes, e.g. "my file". the quotes are
c treated as part of the name, so a name surrounded with quotes is
c not the same as the name without quotes. iosys can currently handle
c 20 units open simultaneously with a total of 1000 files. these limits
c are set in the parameter statement and are readily modified.
c
c      the length of a file or of a transfer (read or write) are in
c terms of the type of data on the file. integer and real files are
c in terms of integer or real words respectively, while character
c data is by character. also note that for character data, the length
c need not be given as it can be assumed to be the length of the
c character string passed in.
c
c      'alignment' has to do with the physical storage of data. if
c alignment is set, new files created will be positioned starting at
c physical disc sectors. this will speed up i/o operations, but will
c also make the physical file larger since gaps will be left between
c logical files. another ramification of alignment is that the
c 'maximum length' of files can be larger than their 'length' since
c iosys will allow a file to expand in to the gap left by alignment.
c alignment is turned off with a 'reset alignment' directive. by
c default, units are not aligned. finally, the alignment of a unit can
c be changed as often as desired since it only affects new files being
c created.
c
c      this section will describe briefly each directive and the other
c arguments associated with it. a 'u' will denote that the argument is
c not referenced when using a directive, and the user should use a '0'
c or any variable in the calling sequence.
c
c manipulating units:
c
c call iosys('open <unit> [as (new,old,unknown)] [on ssd]',size,u,
c            u,name)
c
c           'name' is the hollerith (or character) name or a unit
c           number of the physical disc file to use. it must have 7
c           or less characters.
c
c           'size' is the size of family members on ctss systems.
c
c            the default for an open is 'unknown', which means that if
c            the file exists, it will be opened, if not, it will be
c            created. 'old' specifies that the file must exist;
c            otherwise, there is an error. 'new' guarantees a new file;
c            if it already exists, it will be deleted and then
c            recreated. 'scratch' can be used to create a unique
c            temporary file. in this case, no physical file name is
c            needed as iosys will create one, and when the unit is
c            closed, the physical file will be deleted.
c            'on ssd' specifies that the file should be put
c            on a solid-state disc if possible. if there is not room,
c            or no ssd, the file is created on a normal disc. the ssd
c            should only be used for heavily used, temporary files
c            that only exist as scratch in one program link.
c
c
c call iosys('close (all,<unit>)',u,u,u,u)
c
c           this directive closes either a specific unit or all open
c           units. when a unit is closed, the directory information
c           is saved on the unit so that a subsequent open will restore
c           the unit to the identical state as when it was closed--
c           including the read and write pointers for files.
c
c
c call iosys('dump',u,u,u,u)
c
c           this will dump a listing of the file names, pointers, etc
c           for all units to the output file.
c
c call iosys('destroy [<unit>]',u,u,u,name)
c
c           this directive works in two fashions: if an iosys unit name
c           is given in the directive, that iosys unit is closed and
c           the physical file is destroyed. in this case, the argument
c           'name' is not referenced. otherwise, the physical file
c           'name' is destroyed, regardless of whether it is an iosys
c           file or not.
c
c call iosys('set alignment on <unit>',u,u,u,u)
c call iosys('reset alignment on <unit>',u,u,u,u)
c
c           these calls turn on and off the alignment of new files to
c           physical sector boundaries.
c
c
c manipulating files:
c
c call iosys('create (character integer real ) <file> on <unit>',
c            length,u,u,u)
c
c           this call creates a file of length 'length' data elements
c           on an iosys unit. if 'length' is -1, an 'endless' file
c           is created (see above for a description of endless files)
c
c call iosys('write (character integer real) <file> (to,on) <unit>
c            [without rewinding] [asynchronously]',nwords,array,offset,
c            c)
c
c           'nwords' is the number of data elements to transfer.
c           'array' is the array to transfer from.
c           'offset' is added to the current write pointer before
c               writing.
c           'c' is the character string if writing characters.
c
c           if 'nwords' is -1, iosys will use the current size of the
c           file and transfer that number of data elements, which
c           is a nice shortcut for rewriting a file. the default is
c           to rewind the file before writing. if this is not overidden
c           with 'without rewinding', then 'offset' specifies a
c           location in the file to begin writing (starting at 0).
c           otherwise, 'offset' is added to the current write location
c           before writing. thus, repeated calls 'without rewinding'
c           and an 'offset' of 0 will sequentially write a file. note
c           that the read and write pointers are separate and do not
c           affect each other. for character data, the length need
c           not be given, in which case the length of 'c' will be used.
c
c call iosys('read (character integer real) <file> from <unit>
c            [without rewinding] [asynchronously]',nwords,array,offset,
c            c)
c
c           reading is exactly the inverse of writing, and all options
c           and arguments are identical to the above.
c
c call iosys('end <file> on <unit>',u,u,u,u)
c call iosys('endfile <file> on <unit>,u,u,u,u)
c
c           use this to terminate an 'endless' file. the length of the
c           file is fixed at the length at the time of this call.
c
c call iosys('wait for <unit>',u,u,u,u)
c
c           used to wait for the completion of an asynchronous i/o
c           request. an array being written asynchronously cannot
c           safely be modified until a 'wait' call has been made.
c           converseley, data being read asynchronously cannot be used
c           before a call to 'wait'.
c
c call iosys('rewind (all,<file>) on (all,<unit>) [(read,write,
c            read-and-write)]',u,u,u,u)
c
c           rewinds the read and/or write pointers of one or all of
c           the files on one or all units.
c
c
c inquiries about files:
c
c call iosys('length of <file> on <unit>',length,u,u,u)
c call iosys('get length of <file> on <unit>',length,u,u,u)
c
c           returns the length of the data written
c           to a file. if the file does not exist, -1 is returned.
c
c call iosys('get maximum length of <file> on <unit>',length,u,u,u)
c
c           the maximum amount of data which can be
c           stored on a file. if the file does not exist, a -1 is
c           returned.
c
c call iosys('get read pointer of <file> on <unit>',pointer,u,u,u)
c call iosys('get write pointer of <file> on <unit>',pointer,u,u,u)
c
c           these are the addresses in a file (counting
c           from 0) where the next read or write would occur if the
c           file is not rewound. if the file does not exist, a -1 is
c           returned.
c
c call iosys('does <file> exist on <unit>',u,u,u,answer)
c
c           'answer' returns as 'no' or 'yes'.
