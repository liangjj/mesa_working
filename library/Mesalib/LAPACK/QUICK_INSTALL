This Quick Reference Guide to the installation of LAPACK has been
extracted from the Installation Guide contained in LAPACK/INSTALL.
It is only intended as a quick reference.  The Installation Guide should
be consulted for full details.

To install, test, and time LAPACK:

1. Read the tape or uncompress and tar the file.

   tar  xvf  /dev/rst0  (cartridge tape),  or

   tar  xvf  /dev/rmt8  (9-track tape)
  
   uncompress lapack.tar.z (from a file), and

   tar xvf lapack.tar      (from a file)

2. Test and Install the Machine-Dependent Routines
   (WARNING:  You may need to supply a correct version of second.f and
              dsecnd.f for your machine)

   cd LAPACK/INSTALL
   make
   testlsame
   testslamch
   testdlamch
   testsecond
   testdsecnd

3. Create the BLAS Library, if necessary
   (NOTE:  For best performance, it is recommended you use the
           manufacturers' BLAS)

   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/lsame.f LAPACK/BLAS/SRC/
   cd LAPACK/BLAS/SRC
   make

4. Run the Level 2 and 3 BLAS Test Programs

   cd LAPACK/BLAS/TESTING
   make -f makeblat2
   cd LAPACK/BLAS
   xblat2s < sblat2.in
   xblat2d < dblat2.in
   xblat2c < cblat2.in
   xblat2z < zblat2.in
   cd LAPACK/BLAS/TESTING
   make -f makeblat3
   cd LAPACK/BLAS 
   xblat3s < sblat3.in
   xblat3d < dblat3.in
   xblat3c < cblat3.in
   xblat3z < zblat3.in

5. Create the LAPACK Library

   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/lsame.f LAPACK/SRC/
   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/slamch.f LAPACK/SRC/
   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/dlamch.f LAPACK/SRC/
   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/second.f LAPACK/SRC/
   cp LAPACK/INSTALL/dsecnd.f LAPACK/SRC/
   cd LAPACK/SRC
   make

6. Create the Library of Test Matrix Generators

   cd LAPACK/TESTING/MATGEN
   make

7. Run the LAPACK Test Programs

   cd LAPACK/TESTING
   make

8. Run the LAPACK Timing Programs

   cd LAPACK/TIMING
   make
   xlintims < sblasa.in > sblasa.out
   xlintims < sblasb.in > sblasb.out
   xlintims < sblasc.in > sblasc.out

   repeat timing of blas for c, d, and z
