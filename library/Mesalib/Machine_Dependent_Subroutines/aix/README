  Notes for the AIX Version:
  1. The Makefiles everywhere were originally written for the SUN.  The
SUN compiler is called f77, whereas it is xlf on the IBM.
The simplest way around this is to set an environment variable
     setenv FC "xlf -O"
in the shell and then to instruct make to use environment variables
by invoking

     make -e

 2.  The ops string is dimensioned at 4096 characters.  IBM-AIX 
requires a compiler option to be turned on in order to handle these correctly.
(I believe it is qchar=4096)

 3.  The codes put out some error messages about direct access READS, etc.
This apparently doen't affect the results and I have diverted
the standard error stream in the scripts which control the run.
Whatever the problem is, it would be nice to have it fixed so we
see a real error mesage when one actually happens.

  4.  We use an assembler routine (readrtc.s) to return time information 
which was provided by Harvey Wasserman(LANL) via IBM.  

  5.  The function r1mach has machine constants.  They have been assumed
to be the same as on the SUN.  This should be looked into.  The only one
ever called is r1mach(4), which is called by sgefs.f in ../clams.
