#  NAME: times
#
#  FUNCTION: Read Realtime clock
#
#  EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
#  Standard register usage and linkage convention.
#  Registers used r3-r8
#  Condition registers used: 0
#  No stack requirements.
#  No TOC requirements.
#
#  NOTES:
#  The read is tested to insure a valid value as per the architecture document.
#  Temporary substitute for system times function.
#
#  The addresses are treated as usigned quantities,
#
#  RETURN VALUE DESCRIPTION: Value of RTCU to 0(3), value of RTCL to 4(3).
#
#  r3=0 if ok   r3=-1 if no good read
#
