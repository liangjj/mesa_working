c***description
c                      this routine returns the points and weights associated
c                      with integration in the radial coordinate using the
c                      euler-mclaurin scheme described by murray, et al.
c                      as suggested by them, the transformation with mr=2
c                      is implemented, so that the integrand and its 
c                      derivatives up to the 3m-1=5th vanish at q=0(r=0).
c                      the jacobian [r**2d(r)] is implicitly included, so
c                      the working formula for integrating a polynomial f
c                      using this routine is simply Sum f(p(i))*w(i). also
c                      note that the contributions from the function at the
c                      endpoints (i=0, i=n) are zero, so the sum runs
c                      from i=1,n-1.

c                      p  ---  quadrature points (r), output.
c                      w  ---  quadrature weights, output.
c                      n  ---  number of points in the quadrature, input.
c                  alpha  ---  scale factor which should roughly reflect
c                              the maximum of the function to be integrated.

c     --- divide the integration region into n portions --- 
c         because of the nature of the euler-mclaurin method, the integrand
c         will not contribute to the integral at the endpoints i=0 and
c         i=n, so reflect this in the points and weights returned.
