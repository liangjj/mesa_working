c***description
c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure balance,
c     num. math. 13, 293-304(1969) by parlett and reinsch.
c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 315-326(1971).
c
c     this subroutine balances a real matrix and isolates
c     eigenvalues whenever possible.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
c          array parameter, a, as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.  nm is an integer variable.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix a.  n is an integer variable.
c          n must be less than or equal to nm.
c
c        a contains the input matrix to be balanced.  a is a
c          two-dimensional real array, dimensioned a(nm,n).
c
c     on output
c
c        a contains the balanced matrix.
c
c        low and igh are two integer variables such that a(i,j)
c          is equal to zero if
c           (1) i is greater than j and
c           (2) j=1,...,low-1 or i=igh+1,...,n.
c
c        scale contains information determining the permutations and
c          scaling factors used.  scale is a one-dimensional real array,
c          dimensioned scale(n).
c
c     suppose that the principal submatrix in rows low through igh
c     has been balanced, that p(j) denotes the index interchanged
c     with j during the permutation step, and that the elements
c     of the diagonal matrix used are denoted by d(i,j).  then
c        scale(j) = p(j),    for j = 1,...,low-1
c                 = d(j,j),      j = low,...,igh
c                 = p(j)         j = igh+1,...,n.
c     the order in which the interchanges are made is n to igh+1,
c     then 1 to low-1.
c
c     note that 1 is returned for igh if igh is zero formally.
c
c     the algol procedure exc contained in balance appears in
c     balanc  in line.  (note that the algol roles of identifiers
c     k,l have been reversed.)
