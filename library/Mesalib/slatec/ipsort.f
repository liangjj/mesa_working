c            the array may be sorted in increasing or decreasing order.

c***description
c
c   ipsort returns the permutation vector iperm generated by sorting
c   the array ix and, optionally, rearranges the values in ix.  ix may
c   be sorted in increasing or decreasing order.  a slightly modified
c   quicksort algorithm is used.
c
c   iperm is such that ix(iperm(i)) is the ith value in the
c   rearrangement of ix.  iperm may be applied to another array by
c   calling ipperm, spperm, dpperm or hpperm.
c
c   the main difference between ipsort and its active sorting equivalent
c   isort is that the data are referenced indirectly rather than
c   directly.  therefore, ipsort should require approximately twice as
c   long to execute as isort.  however, ipsort is more general.

c   description of parameters
c      ix - input/output -- integer array of values to be sorted.
c           if abs(kflag) = 2, then the values in ix will be
c           rearranged on output; otherwise, they are unchanged.
c      n  - input -- number of values in array ix to be sorted.
c      iperm - output -- permutation array such that iperm(i) is the
c              index of the value in the original order of the
c              ix array that is in the ith location in the sorted
c              order.
c      kflag - input -- control parameter:
c            =  2  means return the permutation vector resulting from
c                  sorting ix in increasing order and sort ix also.
c            =  1  means return the permutation vector resulting from
c                  sorting ix in increasing order and do not sort ix.
c            = -1  means return the permutation vector resulting from
c                  sorting ix in decreasing order and do not sort ix.
c            = -2  means return the permutation vector resulting from
c                  sorting ix in decreasing order and sort ix also.
c      ier - output -- error indicator:
c          =  0  if no error,
c          =  1  if n is zero or negative,
c          =  2  if kflag is not 2, 1, -1, or -2.
