NOTE:  

To allow for the use of locally provided optimized BLAS and LINPACK softare,
we've got some IFDEFS in the clams routines, and some routines are passed 
through the C preprocessor.

In your .cshrc or .bashrc or whatever you should have something like:

setenv CPP /usr/lib/cpp  (on HP it's /lib/cpp)
setenv CPPFLAGS '-D__$(OPSYS)__'

If your system provides a local BLAS library, you do instead:
setenv CPPFLAGS '-D__$(OPSYS)__ -DLOCALBLAS'

For local linpack:

setenv CPPFLAGS '-D__$(OPSYS)__ -DLOCALLINPACK'

Combine in the obvious way if you have both a local linpack and blas.

Remember to add your local library to the MDLIB variable (-lblas -llinpack) if
you add these options.

If you fail to set CPPFLAGS they you get the default, portable CLAMS.
