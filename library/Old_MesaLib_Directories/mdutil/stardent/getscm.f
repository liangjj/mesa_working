c              fixing bug by subtracting 'curavl' from 'mxaval' if need=-1
c              and in the check for going over the top of core. this should
c              prevent getting more core than have asked for.

c                      call getscm(need,core,ngot,name,fail)
c
c                      module to increment blank common length.
c                      the way it works on the stardent is that the first
c                      call grabs a block of free memory determined
c                      by maxsiz, a parameter that is set by the user.
c                      this parameter is assumed to be in real*8 words.
c                      an offset relative to the beginning of
c                      blank common is returned, which represents
c                      the first word.  this is passed to the main
c                      programs in /memory/. 
c                      subsequent calls cannot increase
c                      the size of the block available, and simply
c                      check to see that it is enough, or return
c                      how much core is available.
c
c
c                      input arguments:
c                         need ... additional number of words requested.
c                         core ... starting address of memory region.
c                         name ... the name of the routine requesting memory.
c                                  used for posting output messages.
c                         fail ... what to do if you can't have that much.
c                                  .eq.0  ... abort if request exceeds availabil
c                                  .ne.0  ... get all you can.
c
c                      output arguments.
c                         ngot ... the number of words obtained.
c
c                      special cases:
c                         if need=-1, get as much core as possible.
c                         if need=0,  return possible expansion relative 
c                                     to 'core' in 'ngot'.
c
c                         as currently implemented, these two cases
c                         return identical results.
