c***description
c
c     this subroutine computes a forward-difference approximation
c     to the n by n jacobian matrix associated with a specified
c     problem of n functions in n variables. if the jacobian has
c     a banded form, then function evaluations are saved by only
c     approximating the nonzero terms.
c
c     the subroutine statement is
c
c       subroutine dfdjc1(fcn,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,iflag,ml,mu,epsfcn,
c                         wa1,wa2)
c
c     where
c
c       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
c         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared
c         in an external statement in the user calling
c         program, and should be written as follows.
c
c         subroutine fcn(n,x,fvec,iflag)
c         integer n,iflag
c         double precision x(n),fvec(n)
c         ----------
c         calculate the functions at x and
c         return this vector in fvec.
c         ----------
c         return
c
c         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless
c         the user wants to terminate execution of dfdjc1.
c         in this case set iflag to a negative integer.
c
c       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
c         of functions and variables.
c
c       x is an input array of length n.
c
c       fvec is an input array of length n which must contain the
c         functions evaluated at x.
c
c       fjac is an output n by n array which contains the
c         approximation to the jacobian matrix evaluated at x.
c
c       ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than n
c         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.
c
c       iflag is an integer variable which can be used to terminate
c         the execution of dfdjc1. see description of fcn.
c
c       ml is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
c         the number of subdiagonals within the band of the
c         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set
c         ml to at least n - 1.
c
c       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable
c         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this
c         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
c         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less
c         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
c         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
c         precision.
c
c       mu is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
c         the number of superdiagonals within the band of the
c         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set
c         mu to at least n - 1.
c
c       wa1 and wa2 are work arrays of length n. if ml + mu + 1 is at
c         least n, then the jacobian is considered dense, and wa2 is
c         not referenced.
