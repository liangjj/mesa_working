c   abstract
c
c   subroutine  steps  is normally used indirectly through subroutine
c   deabm .  because  deabm  suffices for most problems and is much
c   easier to use, using it should be considered before using  steps
c   alone.
c
c   subroutine steps integrates a system of  neqn  first order ordinary
c   differential equations one step, normally from x to x+h, using a
c   modified divided difference form of the adams pece formulas.  local
c   extrapolation is used to improve absolute stability and accuracy.
c   the code adjusts its order and step size to control the local error
c   per unit step in a generalized sense.  special devices are included
c   to control roundoff error and to detect when the user is requesting
c   too much accuracy.
c
c   this code is completely explained and documented in the text,
c   computer solution of ordinary differential equations, the initial
c   value problem  by l. f. shampine and m. k. gordon.
c   further details on use of this code are available in "solving
c   ordinary differential equations with ode, step, and intrp",
c   by l. f. shampine and m. k. gordon, sla-73-1060.
c
c
c   the parameters represent --
c      f -- subroutine to evaluate derivatives
c      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated
c      y(*) -- solution vector at x
c      x -- independent variable
c      h -- appropriate step size for next step.  normally determined by
c           code
c      eps -- local error tolerance
c      wt(*) -- vector of weights for error criterion
c      start -- logical variable set .true. for first step,  .false.
c           otherwise
c      hold -- step size used for last successful step
c      k -- appropriate order for next step (determined by code)
c      kold -- order used for last successful step
c      crash -- logical variable set .true. when no step can be taken,
c           .false. otherwise.
c      yp(*) -- derivative of solution vector at  x  after successful
c           step
c      ksteps -- counter on attempted steps
c      twou -- 2.*u where u is machine unit roundoff quantity
c      fouru -- 4.*u where u is machine unit roundoff quantity
c      rpar,ipar -- parameter arrays which you may choose to use
c            for communication between your program and subroutine f.
c            they are not altered or used by steps.
c   the variables x,xold,kold,kgi and ivc and the arrays y,phi,alpha,g,
c   w,p,iv and gi are required for the interpolation subroutine sintrp.
c   the remaining variables and arrays are included in the call list
c   only to eliminate local retention of variables between calls.
c
c   input to steps
c
c      first call --
c
c   the user must provide storage in his calling program for all arrays
c   in the call list, namely
c
c     dimension y(neqn),wt(neqn),phi(neqn,16),p(neqn),yp(neqn),psi(12),
c    1  alpha(12),beta(12),sig(13),v(12),w(12),g(13),gi(11),iv(10),
c    2  rpar(*),ipar(*)
c
c    **note**
c
c   the user must also declare  start ,  crash ,  phase1  and  nornd
c   logical variables and  f  an external subroutine, supply the
c   subroutine  f(x,y,yp)  to evaluate
c      dy(i)/dx = yp(i) = f(x,y(1),y(2),...,y(neqn))
c   and initialize only the following parameters.
c      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated
c      y(*) -- vector of initial values of dependent variables
c      x -- initial value of the independent variable
c      h -- nominal step size indicating direction of integration
c           and maximum size of step.  must be variable
c      eps -- local error tolerance per step.  must be variable
c      wt(*) -- vector of non-zero weights for error criterion
c      start -- .true.
c      yp(*) -- vector of initial derivative values
c      ksteps -- set ksteps to zero
c      twou -- 2.*u where u is machine unit roundoff quantity
c      fouru -- 4.*u where u is machine unit roundoff quantity
c   define u to be the machine unit roundoff quantity by calling
c   the function routine  r1mach,  u = r1mach(4), or by
c   computing u so that u is the smallest positive number such
c   that 1.0+u .gt. 1.0.
c
c   steps  requires that the l2 norm of the vector with components
c   local error(l)/wt(l)  be less than  eps  for a successful step.  the
c   array  wt  allows the user to specify an error test appropriate
c   for his problem.  for example,
c      wt(l) = 1.0  specifies absolute error,
c            = abs(y(l))  error relative to the most recent value of the
c                 l-th component of the solution,
c            = abs(yp(l))  error relative to the most recent value of
c                 the l-th component of the derivative,
c            = max(wt(l),abs(y(l)))  error relative to the largest
c                 magnitude of l-th component obtained so far,
c            = abs(y(l))*relerr/eps + abserr/eps  specifies a mixed
c                 relative-absolute test where  relerr  is relative
c                 error,  abserr  is absolute error and  eps =
c                 max(relerr,abserr) .
c
c      subsequent calls --
c
c   subroutine  steps  is designed so that all information needed to
c   continue the integration, including the step size  h  and the order
c   k , is returned with each step.  with the exception of the step
c   size, the error tolerance, and the weights, none of the parameters
c   should be altered.  the array  wt  must be updated after each step
c   to maintain relative error tests like those above.  normally the
c   integration is continued just beyond the desired endpoint and the
c   solution interpolated there with subroutine  sintrp .  if it is
c   impossible to integrate beyond the endpoint, the step size may be
c   reduced to hit the endpoint since the code will not take a step
c   larger than the  h  input.  changing the direction of integration,
c   i.e., the sign of  h , requires the user set  start = .true. before
c   calling  steps  again.  this is the only situation in which  start
c   should be altered.
c
c   output from steps
c
c      successful step --
c
c   the subroutine returns after each successful step with  start  and
c   crash  set .false. .  x  represents the independent variable
c   advanced one step of length  hold  from its value on input and  y
c   the solution vector at the new value of  x .  all other parameters
c   represent information corresponding to the new  x  needed to
c   continue the integration.
c
c      unsuccessful step --
c
c   when the error tolerance is too small for the machine precision,
c   the subroutine returns without taking a step and  crash = .true. .
c   an appropriate step size and error tolerance for continuing are
c   estimated and all other information is restored as upon input
c   before returning.  to continue with the larger tolerance, the user
c   just calls the code again.  a restart is neither required nor
c   desirable.
