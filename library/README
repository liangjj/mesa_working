*deck %W% %G%
These directories contain utility routines which are used in more
than one link.  The directories and their contents are:

chr:     this contains most of he character manipulation routines.
clams:   (common los alamos mathematical subroutines)
         this contains routines for performing general matrix operations, etc.
         many of the routines from the blas and eispack which we use in the
         codes are also kept here. the idea is that if you have "fast"
         versions of some of these standard routines available, then it
         should be possible to redefine the PARTS environment variable to
         omit this directory, and the "fast" versions loaded instead.
dft:     these contain routines used by density functional links.
dpintgrl:these are a few routines needed by the rys polynomial section
         of the ci code which must be compiled with the "double precision"
         option on the cray. they are normally compiled on 32-bit unix
         stations with no special flags.
intgrl:  these are various auxiliary routines used by the integral and
         derivative links.
io:      this directory contains the machine independent portions of iosys,
         the i/o manager.
math:    this contains many of the "higher level" matrix manipulation routines,
         diagonalizers, etc. many of them ultimately call a routine from
         the blas or some other standard package.
mdutil:  this directory contains those subroutines which are machine dependent.
sym:     routines to handle the determination of symmetry.
util:    generic matrix output routines, etc.
tcgmsg:  the message passing library from Robert Harrison at PNL. this is
         necessary if the parallel implementation is used. Note that this should
         be done separately. Go to the makefile for that directory.
