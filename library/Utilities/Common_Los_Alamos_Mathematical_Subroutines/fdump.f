c        fdump is intended to be replaced by a locally written          
c        version which produces a symbolic dump.  failing this,         
c        it should be replaced by a version which prints the            
c        subprogram nesting list.  note that this dump must be          
c        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the       
c        xgetua routine.  see xsetua and xgetua for details.
