Note that this routine lagrng.f perhaps should replace the one of similar name
in m501.  also i modified things so that jandks.f and gdmat.f are
identical to the routines in m501.  since we use them many places we should
probably have them in util someday.
  -- another question, why is this routine here. could it be put into
m501,m503,etc. and not have to be called.
