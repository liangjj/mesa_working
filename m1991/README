  This little link performs Mulliken population analyses for individual
orbitals.  A nonstandard route is set up, and a checkpoint file provided.
Sample input follows:
********
$route
  properties=(populations=(bond,orbital,charge))
  vectors="no vector 1",orbitals=(39,40,41)
  print=vector
$nonstd
  19//91;
$end
*********
  The natural orbitals for root 1 will be read from the chk file.  The 
contributions of orbitals 39, 40,and 41 to the bond order,gross orbital 
population, and atomic charge will be reported.
See M1951 for more information.
