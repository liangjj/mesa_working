Truchas<A HREF="truchas_bibliography.html#Truchas">[1]</A> is a suite of programs which can be used to perform and analyze
Hartree-Fock (HF) and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations.
It grew out of the MESA suite of electronic structure programs. 
The latter is based on Hartree-Fock, multi-configuration-self-consistent-field
(MCSCF), and configuration-interaction (CI) methods.
Whereas MESA is primarily
useful for performing accurate CI expansions on the ground and 
excited states of small molecules (2-10 atoms), Truchas is geared towards 
the ground states of moderately large molecules (10-500 atoms).  The DFT code 
is still under active development, and many features which have become
``routine'' in the Hartree-Fock world are still not implemented.  An important
example as of this writing are analytical second derivatives of the DFT
energy with respect to nuclear motion.

Many people have contributed to the development of this program.  The MESA
program was designed and much of it written by Paul Saxe and Rich Martin 
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) from 1985-1987.
Byron Lengsfield (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) 
contributed 
the MCSCF code and derivatives of MCSCF and CI wavefunctions.  
Mike Page (North Dakota State University) contributed the frequency 
and reaction path links.  More recently,
Tom Russo (LANL) added DFT links and second derivatives of 
effective-core-potential
integrals.  Greg Tawa (LANL) is responsible for the solvent reaction field 
capabilities. Additional contributions were made by Barry Schneider (LANL),
Jeff Hay (LANL), and Tony Rappe (Colorado State University).
