   The first group of tests exercises single point scf capabilities.
test1.1   ---  single point, closed shell scf
test1.2   ---  single point, open shell scf
test1.3   ---  single point, general open-shell scf
test1.4   ---  single point, closed shell scf/properties
               (the multipole moments ,field integrals, and fermi
                contact terms have been tested vs. gaussian92.
                the momentum integrals, and the cowan-griffin operator
                have yet to be checked against results known to be
                correct).
test1.5   ---  single point, rohf for cuh+. 
               tests electric field gradients, fermi contact, becke population
               analysis. note that if this test is run with symmetry on the
               hp, it fails for some presently unknown reason although
               it runs fine on the sun.

   links.

   This group checks single point ci capabilities.
test3.1   ---  single point, single reference ci(901,no symmetry)
test3.2   ---  single point, single reference ci(901,symmetry)
               note that this test takes a longer number of iterations
               hp than on the sun.  this is related to differences 
               in the virtual space which come out of m401.  projected
               guess have virtual space which may be rotated differently
               on different machines.

               note that this test currently dies on the hp in m911,
               haven't tried to fix it. there is also a strange 
               bug in m1402 in the sun version(v5.1) i haven't tracked down.

   Test miscellaneous options
test10.1  ---  closed shell scf/point charge field
test10.2  ---  pariser-parr-pople/ci
test10.3  ---  spin-orbit ci (o atom)
               note that 10.3 requires a couple of other input files
               be hanging around which i haven't got around 
               to installing.  ignore this test for now.
test10.4  ---  ci transition dipoles

test11.10 ---  ch2, SVWN, poisson

   Test Kohn variational scattering capabilities.  This also excercises
   optical potentials and then capability to drop functions 
   from the basis set.  These worked on the sun in v4.3.  When symmetry
   was put into m401(v5.1), they stopped working and haven't been fixed.
test12.1  ---  tests ability to drop functions from basis set.
test12.2  ---  forms direct kohn operator, tests expand option in m401.
test12.3  ---  forms optical potential
                  uses tints file generated in test12.2. note that this
                  causes a problem because mesa.sh automatically removes
                  tints at the end of a run. in order to make this test 
                  work mesa.sh should be modified.

   Test solvent dielectric continuum SCRF capabilities.
