This program evaluates overlap integrals between spherical harmonics.
It was used to test the angular quadratures used in the DFT code.
Both Lebedev and Gauss-Legendre quadratures are available.
Lebedev quadratures have been tested against orthonormality of
ylm for 9,11,13,15,17,19,23.  the best we get is ~10**-7, it is not
known whether this is a problem in ylm or the quadratures, but it seems
like something is being done in single precision that shouldn't be.
