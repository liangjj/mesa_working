This directory contains the source files for the mesa checkfile reader
module for ChemistryViewer on AVS.

Mesa checkfile reader may be used in much the same way as MSI's gaussian 
readers.

Also included are two little C hacks.  molvoyeur is something I wrote out
of frustration --- it simply dumps the contents of the molecule data structure
to a file.  "Write PPM" takes the output of the geometry viewer and writes
a Portable PixMap file.  The ppm file can be manipulated by the PBMPlus 
utilities, and converted to any image format imaginable.

To use these, the easiest thing to do is to copy dotavsrc to a file called
.avsrc in your home directory.  The networks will then show up when you 
use the network editor's "read network" command.  The mesa modules will also
show up at the top of the network editor.

These only work on the HP, and require that you build the iosys subset in
the io subdirectory first.  cd io and make there.  Then cd back to here and 
make mesareader2.  The 2 is historical artifact.


The nets I use most (and therefore which stand the greatest chance of actually
working out-of-the-box) are:

mos.net  --- network to display molecule and its MOs from a mesa check file.

ibmelsta.net --- network to display isosurface of density and the paint it
 based on the electrostatic potential at points on that surface.
